# A Day in Stuy
by Team YEEZY: Manish Saha, Jack Schluger

A game with a plot based on a day in Stuy: It is the last day of classes of senior year, and you still have to earn 10 credits to graduate. The game is a RPG, with mini games incorporated throughout the day to earn your last 10 credits, graduate, and win the game.

Special thanks to Mr. Brown
